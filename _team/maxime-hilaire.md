Maxime Hilaire holds a Master’s computer science and has 9 years’ experience as a full stack software engineer. He went across more than 10 successful projects running now in production for Airbus, Sharp, Fox, etc.

Maxime’s challenges as a tech lead are to design and build apps in the cloud that manage tens of millions of documents at scale so applications can ingest TB of data smoothly at the "speed of light".

Maxime’s 2 AWS certifications (Developer & Architect) and in-depth knowledge of NoSql, big data, Cloud, and JavaScript have allowed him to build our platform to the level it’s at today.
