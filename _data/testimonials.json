Not only was he very knowlegable about Nuxeo and Java in general, it was clear he was very experienced as an engineer and was a very good architect. We got tremendous value from the training. Not only did we learn the Nuxeo stack, but we got some key information about upcoming integrations we wanted to do. His suggestions will save us a lot of time and effort, and Iâ€™m very grateful to have had the chance to work with him",

I saw Maxime constantly grow as an engineer, first as a Java developer and later as software and cloud architect. I know for a fact that Maxime knows how to write good code and design an application that works and scales.",
